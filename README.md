# Squadify 

Welcome to Squadify, an attempt to streamline the quick creation of Student Teams for projects. While still in it's infancy, the final project is intended to retain a student's team assignment history as well, and use that to ensure fresh faces each week.


### Invitation
This project is equal parts a problem solving exercise, and a learning experience. Please feel free to contribute either code or advice when and where you feel the need to do so!


You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
